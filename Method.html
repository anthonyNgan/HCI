	<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>A variety of different keyboards are available in today's market that adhere to a different range of consumers based on.  Performance, durability and usability are some features that make huge differences between the types of keyboards.  Some of these types of keyboards include the membrane keyboard and mechanical-switch keyboards.
				Membrane keyboards are the most common type of keyboard as they are low-priced and easily available.  Their low-price means that they can get worn out easily and are not very durable. But they are reliable which is what makes it a popular choice of keyboard.
				Mechanical-switch keyboards are less common and are more expensive compared to the membrane keyboard. Their sturdiness and complexity is what makes it a specialized device and they owe their increased durability to the mechanical switch in each key.</p>
			<h2>Aim</h2>
			<p>To see if there is a relationship between usability of membrane keyboards compared to usability of mechanical keyboards with red and blue switches.</p>

			<div class="container">
			<p>In this section we discuss how we carried out the experiment. 
			Booked a study room at AUT. Invited groups age from 19 - 23 to take three online typing test.</p>
			<h3>Subjects</h3>
			<p>Ten subjects that consisted of eight female and six male participated in this study. These subjects were all university student volunteers at AUT between the ages of 19-23 years. The typing ability of subjects were varied.</p>
			<h3>Equipment</h3>
			<p>For this study three commercially available keyboards were used. The membrane keyboard was Logitech keyboard K120 and the two mechanical keyboards was the CM storm trigger with  Cherry MX red switches and the blue mechanical- switch keyboard was a razor Blackwidow ultimate classic. All keyboards had a QWERTY layout. The keyboards were connected to a HP desktop.</p>
			<p>The study was conducted using an online typing test that has a range of topics and duration of tests to choose from this website http://www.typingtest.com/. For the purpose of this study three different topics were selected for three different keyboards and each selected test was one minute long. The typing test consisted of alphabets, numbers and punctuation. Upon starting the test the subject was presented with a set of text and they had one minute to complete as much as possible. When the one minute was up the test would automatically stop.  At the end of the test the subject was presented with a set of results such as accuracy and words per minute.</p>
			<h3>Tasks</h3>
			<p>Each subject participated in three sessions, one for the membrane, one for the red switch and one for the blue switch. Each time subject took the typing test it was a different test but were all one minute long. Different tests were chosen when testing each keyboard in case the subjects would memorize the test, and this would not give accurate results.</p>
			<h3>Procedure</h3>
			<p>A quiet room was selected for this study that had one desktop computer. The three keyboards were all connected simultaneously to the desktop. The subjects did all three tests consecutively. Each subject was allowed to pick the order in which they tested each keyboard. They did a one minute typing test on the first keyboard then took a break for 1 minute and then did the typing test on the second keyboard. This process was repeated for all keyboards by all test subjects. The results of each test were recorded after each test.</p>

			<h3>Discussion</h3>
			<p>Discussion
The aim of this experiment was to see if using different types of keyboards had an impact on a user's ability to type and overall usability. The membrane keyboard that was used is a type of keyboard that is extremely common in universities, home and office use. The subjects of the study were all university students so were therefore every familiar with this type of keyboard. It showed in their results as the average word per minute and accuracy for this keyboard was 49(wpm)
The fact that this keyboard was familiar had an impact on the results
The two Mechanical keyboards with the red switches and blue switches are keyboards that are popular for gaming. None of the subjects were avid gamers so had never used these types of keyboards previously. It showed in their results as the average word per minute and accuracy for this keyboard was 39.21(wpm)
The subject also found the red switches keyboard harder than the blue one. This was reflected in their results as the average words per minute and accuracy for this keyboard was 38.71
 
<p>For this experiment a two-tailed t test was used in order to either reject or accept the null hypothesis. the null hypothesis was to see if there was a no significant relationship between and the two types of keyboards and the user's ability to type
This gave us a result of MvB = 0.346, MvB = 0.031, and this showed that there was no relationship between the two measured and that using a better quality keyboard did not improve the usability. In this case the null hypothesis was retained. 
this was related to the feel of the keys and the size of the keyboards. When pressing keys on the mechanical keyboards the user had to press the keys harder compared to the membrane keyboard. 
 the mechanical keyboards were bigger than the membrane one.
 <h3>Conclusion<h3> 
 <div class="container3">

<p>Technology is changing everyday and keyboards are one aspect of technology that is changing every day. Membrane keyboards are the more well-known option but mechanical keyboards are not too far behind. even though mechanical keyboards are significantly more expensive compared to it membrane counterpart. It is more of a luxury item and users enjoy it for it  customized feel and features especially if they do encounter prolonged keyboard use for activities such as gaming.
