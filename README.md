First ever website I created (no prior knowledge to HTML or CSS). This was created for the sole purpose to display pictures, 
texts, and videos. In the process I learnt the fundemental of HTML functions which I can transfer to my web development skills.

Please ignore the design of the website as I am a coder and not a designer.
