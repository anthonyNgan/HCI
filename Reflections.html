		<h3>Aloma's Reflections</h3>
		<p>For this project we had to work in teams and it was very important that we had good communication between team members.
		We had face-to-face meeting a few times and a week and used Facebook as another means to communicate. We used Google drive to store all documentation so that all members had access to all documents in real time. When the project was started I was unfamiliar with mechanical keyboards. Membrane keyboards I was used to using and understood how they operate as well as the usability and feel, but I was unable to grasp the concept of the key switches as easily. To remedy this issue, me and my team member did initial research about the keyboards by going to stores that sold them. here we trialled the various types keyboards to get a feel, not just the keyboards used in the experiments but others such as keyboards with green and brown switches. After this activity I was starting to get a better understanding of the technology behind the key switches. For example the blue keyboard switches make an audible "click" sound when a key pressed to let the user know that the key has been pressed sufficiently. I felt that this function was unnecessary especially compared to the price of the keyboard, but after using the keyboard I realized that for gaming and prolonged typing this was an extremely useful feature to have.
		When we set up the experiment we asked for volunteers who might interested in participating. We decided to keep the sample size fourteen. This was a fun activity for me as well as for the participants since it was in casual environment and participants had some healthy competition. We used an online typing test as had different times and topics to choose from so we were in control of the content and the duration of the test. The results that the test gave at the end included accuracy and speed and this is exactly what we were after. We were able to use this on the t test effectively and felt we got adequate results.
		I did some research on haptics and this helped me understand about haptic feedback that takes place when humans interact with interactive devices. Even though the devices we used did not give feedback in its entirety compared to smartphones that vibrate when a number is dialled but the "click" sound of blue switches does offer some haptic feedback.
		This was an interesting project and I realized that I have taken the keyboard; something that I have used for many years for granted. Before this experiment I wasn't very aware of the different types of keyboards that existed as well as the full extent of switch technology. In fact I thought that all keyboards had membrane technology only and couldn't understand why consumers would pay hundreds of dollars for a keyboard when they could get the same item for twenty or thirty dollars. I guess to users who use their keyboards for continued use it is a necessity.  
		I will not be investing in a mechanical keyboard anytime in the new future but I do have a better understanding of why this product is getting popular.

		<h3>Anthony's Reflections</h3>
		<p>Reflection Report:
			<p>I am Anthony Ngan ID#1260723. This is my third year studying bachelors of computer information science. I have previously taken a certificate in science and technology. Sadly, I have no experience related to my degree but hope to in the future in research and development next year.</p>
			<p>My role in this project was to do whatever is possible to carry out the experiment. Aloma my partner in crime had lots of discussions about an interesting topic to undertake. I appreciate the forum as Robert made effort to reply us. We came up with ideas ranging from projectors to hot keys but still no cigar. After one week of back and fourths. We finally came up with an idea, Usability of membrane keyboards vs mechanical keyboards.</p>
			<p>We quickly ran into an issue regards to getting equipment. We asked our friends if they had mechanical keyboards but most of them either did not use one or did not have a spare keyboard. So I went on Trademe bought a few second hand keyboards for this assignment.  A fun experience everything went smoothly.</p>
			<p>One positive note is we have good communication between each other. So we devised a plan to carry the experiment. We decided to book a quiet study room and invite people ages. Consequently they happen to be ages 19 - 23. </p>
			<p>A few days later. We set up the experiment and one by one our participants came and took the test. One keyboard per one minute test. Arranged the keyboard order differently each time. Got a lot of feedback from participants that they were not used to the keyboards that may have affected their performance.  Also, the online typing test were uneven in terms of "some had more symbols, and grammar" however, since we randomise the order of the keyboards this gives each keyboard had a fair amount for each test.</p>
			<p>Once we got the results we distributed work evenly and discussed how we are going to interpret the data.  From our discussion back with Robert, he mentioned a two tail t-test was the best to show comparison between two means which we believe gives us the best results.  I am in charge of the t-test tab. I have taken stats in the past but honestly I do not remember anything as it was a while back. I was in charge of creating the html. (No prior experience in html/css) but thankfully there is website tutorials from code academy and W3school. I am no expert but really enjoyed the experience. Meanwhile, Aloma is busying finding information for the keyboards and learning everything she can because she has not used a mechanical keybaord before and wrote the theory behind these phenomena's. She mostly wrote the information on the website.</p>
			<p>Personal findings of the study were that there's a lot of room for error but we tried our best to reduce so that they do not affect our results.  Also a lot uncertainty whether we were approaching the experiment in the best form so other variables would not affect such as participants were not allow to look at the test because they might remember the words.</p>

			<p>I have not burnt a cd in a long time.</p>
