		<p>Components of the keyboard consists of key caps and rubber domes and are positioned above a three-layer plastic membrane that stretches across the whole length of the keyboard. The top membrane layer has a printed keyboard and a spacer sheet with holes in the middle. As the user presses the key, the top membrane is pushed through the spacer hole and makes contact with the bottom membrane. So what takes place is that the conductive point on the top layer of the membrane pushes through a hole in the middle buffer layer to contact conductive material on the bottom layer. This creates a short circuit and generates the keystroke completing the circuit. The key returns to its regular position when released.
The membranes are thin plastic sheets that contain flexible printed circuits made of electrically conductive ink.
The keys of membrane keyboards can lose or gain their elasticity over time. Inconsistencies can result  on how much force is needed throughout the keyboard and this can slow down typing speed. 
Other factors that can  affect the keyboard performance can be caused built-up of
debris, rubber dome fatigue, manufacturing imperfections and ultraviolet radiation. The keys cannot be cleaned or repaired easily. As such, they're rated at approximately 10 million keystrokes, and performance can start degrading after just a few months. </p>

		<p>In mechanical-switch keyboards each key has a switch below it. When the key is pushed down, the switch completes the circuit and notifies the computer of the keystroke command. There's an audible "click" when this happens and the key springs back into place. The key only needs to be pushed down halfway for the command to be activated. Furthermore, the audible and tactile responses help improve typing speed and accuracy.
Mechanical-switch keys spring back consistently and quickly after being depressed, and their performance doesn't deteriorate over time. They're resistant to debris build-up because the key switch mechanism is protected, sealed, as well as be easily cleaned. The rate for a mechanical-switch keyboard is about 20 to 50 million strokes. If a key becomes faulty, the switch can be replaced. Mechanical keyboards are very much valued by fast typists and gamers, as they have a springiness, feel and the "click" sound which are sought-after features by these types of users.
Different colored key switches are available such as red and blue and they vary slightly in their functionality.</p>
