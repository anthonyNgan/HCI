			<p>The results that were noted were of the speed and accuracy of performance using the membrane, red and blue mechanical-switch keyboards. These results were the used for analysis by a conducting a two tailed t- to see if there was a relationship between usability and the type of keyboard. This was compared to the null hypothesis to give accurate results. The null hypothesis states that there is no statistical significance in a given set of observations. In other words there is no relationship between two measured observations, or groups. The null hypothesis can be rejected or accepted and in doing so it might be observed that there is a relationship between two observations.</p>
