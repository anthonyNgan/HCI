		<h4>Haptics</h4>
			<div class="container">
			<p>Haptics is any type of interaction and manipulation that is associated with  touch and control sensation. There are different forms of haptics such as haptic communication, haptic perception and haptic technology. Haptic technology is when a technological device is used to interact with a user using the sense of touch. Haptics is used in various devices such as touch screens on smartphones.  when a phone number is dialled on a smartphone the vibration that is created when a number is dialled is an example of haptic technology. This vibration sensation is felt by the user in their hand or other parts of the body. This is an important feature to have because without it the user would not know if the task had taken place. 
	Haptic interfaces are devices that facilitate human interactions with virtual environments. This is done to help with tasks that are are primarily operated by human hands. The haptic interface receives motor action commands from the human user and is then able to demonstrate  relevant images back to the user. 
	Devices such as computer keyboards are simple haptic interfaces.  They are simple because they are only able to send the user's commands to the computer but does not give the user any feedback to show that command has been received. 
	In the case of the membrane and mechanical keyboards the membrane keyboard does not allow for haptic feedback and neither does the mechanical keyboard but the "click" sound made when a key pushed can act as haptic feedback.
